# BZSE

## About
BZSE (Benzinga Stock Exchange) is a stock portfolio management app built with AngularJS (v1.3.15) as a [coding excercise](http://static.careers.benzinga.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/benzinga-code-challenge.html). It is not connected to live stock market data and is only intended for demonstration purposes.

The app is running at http://bzse.ryangallen.com/. Because it is a demo, only the following stock symbols are available:

- `AAPL` (Apple)
- `F` (Ford Motor Co.)
- `GE` (General Electric)
- `GOOG` (Google)
- `JNJ` (Johnson & Johnson)
- `MSFT` (Microsoft)
- `NFLX` (Netflix)
